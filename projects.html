          <h3>Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)</h3>
          <p>
            An <strong>R package</strong> that builds a long-format dataset from India’s 
            <em>Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)</em> and stores it in a local 
            <strong>DuckDB</strong> database.
          </p>
          <p>
            The package provides helpers to download and organise multiple ASI rounds,
            query tables on the fly with <code>dplyr</code>, and construct
            <code>state × industry × year</code> panels for further analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example use cases include computing indicators such as average manufacturing
            days by rural/urban status, and mapping state-level industrial activity with
            <code>sf</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>.

          <h3>Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE)</h3>
          <p>
            An <strong>R package</strong> for working with the 
            <em>Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE)</em> for India,
            exposed as a long-format database via <strong>DuckDB</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The package downloads raw ASUSE files, builds a local database, and lets users
            query large tables directly with <code>dplyr</code> (e.g. rural–urban shares
            of enterprises, sectoral distributions, and regional aggregates).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is designed for scalable exploration of the unincorporated sector, including
            tasks like computing the proportion of rural enterprises by NSS-region and
            visualising patterns on maps using <code>sf</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)</h3>
          <p>
            An <strong>R package</strong> that constructs a long-format dataset from the 
            <em>Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)</em> for India and serves it via a 
            local <strong>DuckDB</strong> database.
          </p>
          <p>
            It streamlines downloading and organising PLFS household and person files, and
            enables fast queries with <code>dplyr</code> for tasks such as tracking the
            composition of households by social group or examining changes across survey
            rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The package is geared towards labour market research, including applications
            like mapping mean household expenditure by state with <code>sf</code> and 
            <code>ggplot2</code>, despite fragmented documentation and inconsistent codes.

          <h3>BharatViz</h3>
          <p>
            An <strong>interactive Shiny dashboard</strong> that brings together industrial
            clusters (from ASI/ASUSE), labour market inequality and migration (PLFS), and
            socio-economic deprivation (SECC/NFHS/Census) in a single interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can explore heatmaps, graphs, and bivariate maps; overlay datasets; and
            probe questions such as: 
            <em>“Do industrial clusters coincide with deprived districts?”</em> or  
            <em>“Which industries should a district diversify into next?”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The dashboard includes trajectory classification, diversification suggestions,
            and night-lights-based validation of emerging clusters.
